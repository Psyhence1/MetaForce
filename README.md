# MetaForce
A repository of code and data sets for the interpretation and analysis of metaphors.
-
Welcome to the MetaForce repo!
We produce and collect code and data sets to study metaphors and creativity.
...
The files in here have been curated for the purpsoe of developing machine learning code to study the intricacies of metaphor interpretation in natural language processing.
The projects developed from here are striving to study:
    + how humans encode layers of meaning in words
    + how to decode these layers of meaning, to reach for new ways of interpretation 
    + how to find and filter for hidden meaning in communication
    + how creativity is fostered by metaphorization of meaning
    + how to train AI which can naturally develop metaphorization as means of interpretation and communication 

Everyone is welcome to contribute for this project under an MIT Licence.
